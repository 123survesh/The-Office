# The Office
The Office is a 2D, drag and drop game, where the player has to drag and drop service men to repair the things that break in the office. This game was made made during the Global Game Jam of 2020. The game is in a playable state but it has some really solid bugs. 
I did not know my team mate @Sushanth15 before this gamejam. He was the one who came up with the idea for the game and worked up all the ideas for how things should be done. And we finished up the game with the help of @harish-hammer.
